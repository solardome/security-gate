# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Report privately to the maintainers with:

- affected version/commit
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment
- suggested mitigation (if available)

## Scope

This project is local-only by design and does not use external APIs. Security issues include, but are not limited to:

- input validation bypasses
- determinism violations in decision output
- accepted-risk governance bypasses
- hard-stop precedence bypasses
- unsafe execution of untrusted content

## Response Expectations

Maintainers will triage and respond as quickly as possible. High-impact issues are prioritized.
